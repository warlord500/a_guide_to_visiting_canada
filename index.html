				<h2> Different food you can get</h2>
					
				<p>There are lots of little treats to get in Canada that you normally can't get in the USA.	
				The favorites of my family are some of the flavored chips like pickled and ketchup which use to be unavailable to 
				the USA for a while.  Below is a list of the more common items. </p>
				
				<!--
					Ok upon prior thought, I realized this code maybe overwhelming with a lot of tags
					if your a new to reading html.

						<h4>Gravy And Fries</h4>
						<img alt="Gravy Fries" src="images/gravy_fries.jpg">
						<p>
							A classic tradition in Canada is to dip standard French fries in gravy, rather than the American ketchup or ketchup-mayo mix!!
							Many Canadians pour gravy on top of the fries(shown above). Which really mixes the gravy and fries together!!
							you can get make these at home, there a few places in a Canada that will make them for you!
